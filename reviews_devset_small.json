I looked for a leak, and rationed that I probably lost the oil because the ground is uneven and the rudimentary air hole in the oil plug lets oil out if it is pointed down hill.I added oil and worked the summer. At the end of the summer, same story, several quarts low. I added more oil and did not observe any leak while it was running, but did observe oil under the oil tank.This year I let it to my nephew who brought it back to my house and I put it in my garage. Voila, I saw an oil leak. Using a light I found the leak was a 1.5\" crack in the tank under the engine. I contacted Troy Bilt and told them what I told you. They will not warranty this work and told me to take it to a certified Troy Bilt repair center who quoted me nearly $800 to repair it.It is unfortunate this company does not support customers any better than this. Had I put this splitter on concrete two years ago, I would have found the leak while still under warranty. Even though I reported the leaking oil occurred during the warranty period, and only found the leak last week, they still won't warranty it. This is sad because Troy Bilt used to be something you could buy with confidence, but apparently not anymore. There are too many reports of inadequate welds and cracking tanks to recommend this splitter to anyone. Certainly the hydraulics still work good, but a leaking tank is just plain a bad idea.PaulWhen I researched log splitters, I settled on Troy-Bilt. I examined three models and chose the 33 ton splitter for its power, design and of course the reputation Troy-Bilt has. It comes with a Honda 8 HP engine, which on other slitters is an expensive upgrade.I read the review about it being shipped in parts. I ordered it and found the instructions to actually being helpful. Very well thought out and engineered, I put it together in about 4.5 hours, from the time I opened the crate to when I split the first log. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in a splitter and Amazon's price is the best on the market. I do recommend you have an assistant in putting it together, although one person can assemble it. Please note you also need 8 gallons of hydraulic fluid, not seven. You have to allow for the hoses, cylinder, and filter.I finally got a chance to use it on some 24-30 inch dried cottonwood logs. Impressive is all I have to say. Cottonwood tears, not splits and the family splitter couldn't touch this stuff. This splitter tore right threw it. When it hit nasty narly wood, the ram slowed down and continued on. The auto return feature also is a nice touch, it retracts while you get another piece. I have no regrets and look forward to taking it out in the spring to split the other 10 - 12 cords of hardwood. Right now there is 3 feet of snow on the ground so this will unfortunately have to wait until spring.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Amended I love it", "unixReviewTime": 1168732800, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2007", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

Simmons", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "After my long lasting Troy-Built push lawn mower died, I decided to buy a new one instead of getting it fixed.  After reading and researching on-line reviews for self-propelled lawn mowers it seemed they started in the price range around $300.  I had never had a self-propelled mower before.  But, the thought that if the wife or kids wanted to volunteer mowing our small yard a self-propelled mower would make it a more enjoyable experience.Several features I was looking for were: (1) Larger rear wheels, (2) Dependable engine, (3) Decent warranty, (4) Variable speed drive.  This mower has all these except the variable speed, which was not a problem for me since a little downward pressure on the handle will make the front wheels lift off and slow it down if needed.  With the larger rear wheels it seems to accomplish this and turning fairly well.  Also, this is the &lt;&lt; ONLY >> mower in this price range that has a dependable HONDA engine.  Looking at the reviews of more expensive mowers, the HONDA engines were a major selling point considering their ease of starting and dependability.  Some of the reviewers here at Amazon had indicated they had problems with that engine.  For the price to value features of this mower, I was willing to take a gamble.This last weekend it was delivered to our doorstep. The time it had taken since my old mower had died and it arrived had been a little over two weeks.  The lawn looked like a jungle and I was in a hurry to get it mowed before the neighbors started to complain.  Probably should have taken the time to read the instructions first before I assembled and started it though.To start off, there were only 4 bolt/wing nuts to make up as a previous reviewer had indicated. A mistake I made was not putting them in the correct direction since the grass collection bag interfered with the lower ones until I turned them 180 degrees about.  The instructions probably would have told me this if I had read them.  Also, the oil that came in the bottle was just a tad more than the capacity of the oil reservoir.  DON'T OVERFILL a gas engine.  Luckily, I checked the dip stick and saw that it was a little overfull after dumping the WHOLE bottle in.  I emptied a little oil out until the dipstick showed the correct level and continued the startup process by filling the gas tank.At that point I had to get the manual out to see a picture of which way the gas shut-off valve should be pointed.  Also, the spark plug wire had to be attached to the spark plug.  OK... ready to fire her up.  I turned the throttle to choke and gave a couple of tugs.  Nothing.  Huh, maybe I got a dud like the previous reviewer on Amazon.  A couple of more uneventful tugs and I realize the carburetor was flooded with gas.  So, I took the air filter off to let the carburetor air out.A few minutes passed and I replaced the air filter.  A couple of more tugs proved uneventful.  Wow, I stood back in thought looking at the new lifeless piece of equipment I had put so much hope and anticipation in.  Then it dawned on me, I may have to hold the top lever on the handle back when I was pulling the starting cord.  I turned the throttle to medium, held one hand on the \"kill switch\" lever on the handle and pulled the cord.  The engine burst to life!  If only I had taken the time to read all the instructions, I probably would have had a more successful startup.Nah, I knew what I was doing?  Besides I had a jungle to mow.  The jungle is gone now and I am very confident in this machine to perform well for me in the future.  I even went out a couple of days later while writing this review to test it to see if it started again.  I turned the throttle to \"choke\" and with one tug it started again.  Also, I noticed the throttle move on it's own down to a run position instead of the \"choke\" position after it started.  Very cool.Who knows maybe the wife and kids will use this thing?  If nothing else, they can start it for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "What an Exceptional Value!", "unixReviewTime": 1123977600, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2005", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

Last summer I had just decided that gardening was out for the following season because it just broke my back leaning over or sitting on the ground (even with a pad) and I would be unable to move for days after being outside and working.  This past year I got proactive (I have a HUGE yard and a garden with tons of unwelcomed visitors).  I read the reviews here and decided on this rocker style chair.  SO HAPPY!Why:  It is insanely comfortable.  It has a nice water, dirt and and clumsy/rough behavior resistant fabric and construction, enough cushion, ergonomic rump molding and tilts plenty far forward, sideways and back (while feeling perfectly safe and stable) to get my garden work done.I did not once feel like I was going to tip or that it was going to fly out from under me.It is incredibly durable and very convenient.  It slid and ground into gravel all spring and summer at least 4 days per week for at least a half day at a session without showing any real wear (even on the bottom plastic).  I shoved weeders,scissors, clippers, hand trowels etc. into the pockets and they are in good condition.  No holes, frays... nothing.  There is also storage on the bottom so there is no need for lots of ups and downs (a bonus for the back).  It is light enough to carry by the handle (fabric in back) by one hand and carry a trash can in the other no problem.I also use it when washing the dog in the tub.I can garden day after day with this thing (with occasional stretches) and feel pretty darn good at the end of the day.Also - I was originally wanting a chair that had wheels.  So glad I did not go that way.  I would have been sinking in the dirt and grass, it would not have survived the gravel and this thing (although I am sure they do not recommend it) can scoot easily while still under you.

We purchased the Meco 9309W deluxe grill and could not be happier. In a nutshell, it is one of the best purchases I have ever made. The grill is small enough that we can store it in our apartment. It is unobtrusive and fits so easily in a spare corner that you wouldn't even know it was there. When we want to use it we simply put it out on our (very) small porch and can actually grill from inside. (Note: this is not an indoor grill.)Though the grill is electric, it cooks very much like a gas grill. Depending on what you are cooking, flareups and smoke can occur, but they make the food taste even better. Grease drips into the bottom of the grill, where there is a small hole for drainage. However, you need to put something beneath to catch the excess. I wish that the sellers would supply a small cup to catch the drippings, as there is a space for one, but a cup made of aluminum foil works just as well and is easy to clean up.The Meco grill is well made and cooks wonderfully. I use it several times a week (sometimes twice a day on weekends). It has plenty of space, so I can cook enough meat and vegetables for four or more people simultaneously. I have not yet used the rotisserie feature, but based on my experiences thus far I am sure it would produce great tasting food.For such a wonderful grill, the price was very reasonable; also, grilling has not increased our electric bill, so it seems comparable to using the oven/stove. I love the Meco grill and look forward to many more years with it.

It is sturdy, maneuverable and versatile. All four of the tires required additional air pressure which can only be done with a manual pump per the users manual. But I used my electric emergency tire pump from the trunk of my car. Just keep in mind that due to the low volume of air in the tires they fill up fast - don't go to the gas station! There is a little confusion about the correct psi for the tires (manual says one thing and tires sidewall says another). Use the lower. Shipping box arrived in OK condition, not perfect. But there were no parts missing. Assembly takes awhile (and more tools than the manual states - screw driver and plyers aren't going to get the job done). Ratchet set needed if you don't want a \"repetitive motion injury\"!
